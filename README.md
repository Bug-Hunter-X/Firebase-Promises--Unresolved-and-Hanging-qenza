# Firebase Unresolved Promise Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where Firebase promises hang indefinitely, preventing application progress.  The bug is difficult to track down because standard debugging tools may not reveal the issue.  The solution demonstrates a robust error-handling mechanism to address this type of issue.

## Bug Description
Under specific network conditions or due to server-side issues, Firebase promises may remain in a pending state without ever resolving or rejecting. This can lead to application freezes and unexpected behavior. This example shows this issue using a simple Firebase function call.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing more robust error handling and timeout mechanisms within the asynchronous operations.  A timeout is set for the promise to resolve.  If the timeout is exceeded, an error is thrown, and an alternative action or error message is displayed.
