The Firebase SDKs may sometimes return promises that are never resolved or rejected, leading to deadlocks or unexpected behavior. This can occur due to network issues, server-side errors, or bugs within the SDK itself.  Identifying these issues can be challenging because standard debugging techniques might not reveal the root cause.
